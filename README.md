Just a simple Morse trainer for the M5Stack Cardputer, with wpm, level and volume settings. <br/>
Levels are based on the lcwo.net trainer. <br/>
Speed is calculated using the Farnsworth method. <br/>
There is a Game option that keeps track of high scores per level(not per wpm!), and a Test option with 10 groups of 5 random chars. <br/>
An SD card is mandatory. <br/>
Tone can be set up in the config file created on first run, the default is 600Hz.<br/>
.bin is available in M5Burner as "Morse Trainer"<br/>
