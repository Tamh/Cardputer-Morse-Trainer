Just a simple Morse trainer for the M5Stack Cardputer, with wpm, level and volume settings. 
Levels are based on the lcwo.net trainer. 
Speed is calculated using the Farnsworth method. 
There is a Game option that keeps track of high scores per level(not per wpm!), and a Test option with 10 groups of 5 random chars. 
An SD card is mandatory. 
Tone can be set up in the config file created on first run, the default is 600Hz.
.bin is available in M5Burner as "Morse Trainer"
